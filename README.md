# ResponsivePortfolio

For this project, I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create my own portfolio site with a responsive design intened to render well on a variety of devices. I've included a Navbar that remains consistent throughout each page, as well as a sticky footer. There are 3 pages which include my personal bio, my portfolio (more to come!), and a contact form.
